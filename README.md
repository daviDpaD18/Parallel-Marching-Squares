# Parallel-Marching-Squares
A Marching Squares algorithm implementation using Pthreads
The Marching Squares algorithm, when implemented in parallel, greatly enhances performance by utilizing multi-threading capabilities. By splitting tasks across multiple threads, the algorithm can efficiently handle large images and produce contours simultaneously. This project focuses on parallelizing the Marching Squares algorithm using Pthreads in C/C++. The Marching Squares algorithm is commonly employed for contouring images and finds applications in diverse fields like topographic or thermal mapping.
